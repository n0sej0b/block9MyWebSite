            <p>I have had a passion for image manipulation, photography, and video graphics since an early age. With my family and friends always having my back, they have allowed me to bring that love and support to be carried into my work.
                I have worked with/on musicians such as Beyonc√© , Lady Gaga, Mariah Carey, Sean Combs, Jason Derulo, Kanye West, and many others as well as movie stars from Marvel movies to romantic comedies. 
               </p>
            <p> I have specialized in doing beauty work over the years and have taken these skills with me into the field of photography and restoring old family photos.
                Working from graphic design to feature films, I continue to grow my skills in all areas. </p>
            <p>I have worked with some great teams to create award-winning features and productions, and thrive in collaborative settings.
                I enjoy the challenges that are always waiting for artists in the media field, and I especially love that moment when you can step back, look at the finished product, and be proud that it turned out even better than you had imagined. 
                </p>
            <p>Ever learning and adjusting to the styles of a diverse range of clients, I have and will continue to produce quality work for my clients.</p>
